I'm trying to display the information in the xml file in a table. With the display table object I know I'm going to have "to set the model" by making a class
and then a subclass but this framework is so under documented that there's hardly any code that works or code that can display how this works. 

If you compiled this it would look like =>  https://imgur.com/a/yUPDsTs

So if you can help me put a table on the application below the four buttons it would be appreciated.
