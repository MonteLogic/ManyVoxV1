# ManyVoxV1


If you compiled this it would look like =>  https://imgur.com/a/yUPDsTs

The current function of ManyVox is to summarize vocal stems and use algorithms to reduce volume and avoid the automating of knob movement normally found 
on the channel mixer. 

Thus, reducing the need for compression as well as reducing the amount of time and effort spent on adjusting the volume of a certain vocal stem track.
