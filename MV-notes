There saying that its getting cleaned up by other parts of the file. 

So I'm going to create a new file where I only write. 


I think that public AudioAppComponent or maybe public ChangeListener
has something to do with it                        
                        
                        Because it has been counted how many times loadData has been ran, however th tree values are only shown once(?)
