There saying that its getting cleaned up by other parts of the file. 

So I'm going to create a new file where I only write. 

It might be a good idea to just create the file. 

ID is going to be a unique identifier 
PATH 

I think I'm going to work on moving the current one down before adding other things like adding keys. 

 
I want to make a function that can only read the parameter. 

It might be a good idea to create like an audio rating engine to do some of the functionality. 

I think I need to bring back the section where the options for the audio are. 

The only thing I really did was add a set of things to make logic be written onto
a xml file. And add libkeyfinder to the source code. I also made it where 
both mp3's and wav's can be listened to--possibly .m4a's. And I added a few buttons. 

So I think I'm going to add all of that logic to AudioPlayer and then after that, 
the noise crunch thing will be forever solved and then I can focus on instatiing objects from the libkeyfinder library.
