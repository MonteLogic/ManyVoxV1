There saying that its getting cleaned up by other parts of the file. 

So I'm going to create a new file where I only write. 

It might be a good idea to just create the file. 

ID is going to be a unique identifier 
PATH 

I think I'm going to work on moving the current one down before adding other things like adding keys. 

 
I want to make a function that can only read the parameter. 

It might be a good idea to create like an audio rating engine to do some of the functionality.
