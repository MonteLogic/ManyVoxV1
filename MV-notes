I gotta figure out how to make TableListBoxTutorial dispaly in a opened window. 


It would be cool if the first window showed, the previous unsorted stem vox and the second showed the sorted stem vox. 

I am just going to rank the entire average first and then worry about parceling out each part. 


I'm struggling with async proccesses and I have no idea why that 
window was so adimantly against not having a button that directly matched
it and having that button be on screen. 

I'm going to implement the AudioFormatReader and then record that metadata into the .xml file.
